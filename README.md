# final-project-java

This is the final project for my CIS-171 Java course at Kirkwood Community College. Below is a journal of all the things I learned throughout the class.

## Introduction

In the introduction of **Java CIS-171** we setup and learned how to use a program called Git to upload files to GitHub. Additionally, we learned how to use markdown. Learning how to use Git was entirely new to me, but I already had quite a bit of experience using markdown. Although I did learn a few new things in class about markdown such as embedding images in a file like so:

1. git add [filename] README.md
1. git status
1. git commit -m "changes made to files"
1. git push origin main


## Chapter 1

in Chapter 1 of **Java CIS-171** we learned about some of the java fundamentals. this includes things like basic arithmetic operators, boolean operators, conditional statements, try/catch statements, for loops, using the Scanner class to get input, etc. . This all came quite easily to me, as I am already quite familiar with Java.
